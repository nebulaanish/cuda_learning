This repository contains the notes and example codes that I've written during my journey of learning CUDA programming language. 

The folder `notes` contain the topic that I go through each day. And the `code` folder contains all the coding exercises that I've done during the process of learning. I've tried to add intuition behind certain choice of code at a lot of places. But, few may require additional context to understand.

I'm following the resource from NVIDIA's official website for learning CUDA. Additionally, I'm using questions in tensara for practising problems. I will add any aditional resources worth mentioning as I move forward with my learning journey.

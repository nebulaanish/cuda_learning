# Day 1

Cuda Computing:
Solves problems in parallel to increase the speed of computation. <br>
- Use cases: 
    - Ray tracing
    - Video processing
    - Optmize matrix multiplication in Neural Networks.


- Memory bandwidth is the major bottleneck. But why??? (we'll figure it out later).
- Tried Installing cuda, version mismatch between nvidia driver's cuda dependency and installed cuda version. Tried installing cuda12.9 to match nvidia driver. 
- Tried running hello world cuda c++ program on google colab. (Worked)
- Process: <br>
    1. Code in `hello.cu` file.
    2. Run following command in code block while selecting a GPU Runtime(T4 GPU) in free tier.
        ```
        !nvcc -arch=sm_75 hello.cu -o hello
        !./hello
        ```
